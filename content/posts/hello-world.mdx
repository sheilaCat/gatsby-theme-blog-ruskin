Hello, world! This is a demo post for `gatsby-theme-blog`.

Delete me, and get writing!

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "gatsby-theme-blog", // highlight-line
    "gatsby-theme-notes"
  ]
};
```

This is another paragraph after the code block.

## This is a secondary heading

```js:language=javascript
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "theme-ui";
import theme from "./theme";

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
);
```
